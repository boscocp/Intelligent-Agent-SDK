# Intelligent-Agent-SDK
Project aimed at teaching intelligent agents with unity based on the book Artificial Intelligence, a modern approach. [Flex Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach). For now the project have pathfinding for multiple agents unsing Depth-first search (DFS), Breadth-first search (BFS) and A* (A star).
